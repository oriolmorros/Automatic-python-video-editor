# Automatic-python-video-editor
A project with several programs built to automate the processing in a certain way of raw videos.
The only previous installation is python 3. and the moviepy library.
In order to run the programs one only needs to add the raw videotu cut in mp4 format and 1 to 5 music clips (called music 1, music 2..., music 5)for the videocut program. For the remixer only 1 music is necessary.
The remixer will divide the video in as many parts as inputed and cut as much as inputted, then put it in b&w or not and join all the parts with the music of choice. If the music clip is shorter than the video, the video lenght will be cut.
The cutter slices the video in as many parts as desired and assigns music to each of them.
Both can be very useful for fast low precision editing of long events, aswell as other genral usages.
